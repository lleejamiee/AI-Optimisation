New Reference Material
Hey there,
 
Just letting you know that a couple of the steps have changed for the Outlook sign up process. I have linked them below:

- Open your web browser and go to the Microsoft Account sign up page by visiting this link: https://signup.live.com/ or you can directly visit www.outlook.com and click on "Sign Up" in the top right corner of the screen.
- On the sign-up page, enter your preferred email address (this will be your new Microsoft Outlook account). Make sure it's unique and easy to remember.

Cheers,
Eugene Edwards
